31. Mock the `HealthService` in tests to isolate the controller logic.
32. Validate the HTTP status of the health check response in unit tests.
33. Validate response body in unit tests, ensuring the message matches the expected health status.
34. Use `@SpringBootTest` to load the Spring context for integration tests.
35. Validate the correct loading of health check routes in `application.yml` configuration.
36. Add test for non-existing routes to return a `404 Not Found` status.
37. Ensure that the gateway health check endpoint returns a valid response when queried.
38. Ensure that a health check response is returned when the application is running and available.
39. Implement exception handling for the health endpoint to handle any errors in service.
40. Use `@PostConstruct` in `HealthService` to initialize resources or connections for health checks.
41. Add proper logging in `HealthService` to trace the status of health checks.
42. Add `/health/status` endpoint to allow more granular health checks if required.
43. Implement a custom health check strategy for complex service status monitoring.

45. Set the `management.endpoint.health.show-details=always` in `application.yml` to always show health details.
46. Use `@Test` in `HealthServiceTests` to validate that health checks work as expected.
47. Test the integration with the Actuator health check system.
48. Ensure the service properly returns `200 OK` for health check endpoints when the system is healthy.
49. Ensure `404 Not Found` is returned for non-existing paths during route tests.
50. Document the health check process and provide sample configurations for further customization.

Here are additional steps that may have been left out, further clarifying the implementation and configuration of the `micro-arch-health` module:

51. **Add Spring Boot Actuator's health check HTTP endpoint** in `application.yml` (e.g., `management.endpoint.health.enabled=true`).
52. **Ensure actuator endpoints are exposed** in `application.yml` by setting `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info`.
53. **Configure a custom health indicator** for more granular monitoring in `HealthService` (e.g., database or external API health).
54. **Implement fallback health checks** in `HealthService` for degraded service states.
55. **Add specific error handling for health checks** in `HealthService` to gracefully handle failures (e.g., service unavailability).
56. **Enable health check authentication and authorization**, if necessary, by configuring security settings for actuator endpoints.
57. **Use `@ControllerAdvice`** for global exception handling in health-related controllers to return proper error messages.
58. **Modify health check response format** to match JSON schema (e.g., `{ "status": "UP", "details": {...} }`).
59. **Set up logging for health check failures**, ensuring critical health issues are logged and monitored for further action.
60. **Configure custom health check thresholds** (e.g., timeouts or failure counts) in `application.yml` to define when a health check is considered "down."
61. **Create health check monitoring services** in `HealthService` to call external services (e.g., a third-party API or database) to check their status.
62. **Write additional integration tests for health checks**, including testing custom health indicators (e.g., database, APIs).
63. **Ensure that all endpoints return proper HTTP status codes** like `200 OK` for healthy status, `503 Service Unavailable` for unhealthy status.
64. **Add health check routes with custom health statuses**, such as `/health/custom` for custom health checks beyond the default.
65. **Document how to extend the health check system** in the `README.md`, including adding new health indicators for third-party services or databases.
66. **Configure `management.health.livenessState.enabled=true`** to expose liveness checks for Kubernetes readiness.
67. **Verify that health checks do not interfere with regular service functionality**, ensuring the application continues to perform other operations correctly.
68. **Use Actuator's `health` group to create aggregate health indicators**, such as an overall status of database, disk space, and network.
69. **Test health checks on different environments (e.g., local, staging, production)** to ensure health status consistency.
70. **Enable custom HTTP headers in health check responses** for more secure or detailed monitoring information.
71. **Add metric support for health checks** by integrating `Micrometer` and configuring monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana.
72. **Ensure compatibility with cloud platforms**, where health check results can be integrated with platform-specific health management (e.g., Kubernetes).
73. **Implement retries or fallback mechanisms** for health checks that depend on external services to avoid failure when services are temporarily unreachable.
74. **Verify that health check paths are properly ignored by any security filters** (e.g., CSRF, API key), or explicitly exempt them from security layers.
75. **Configure `spring.health.check.endpoint.include`** to select specific health indicators for more fine-grained control over exposed checks.
76. **Ensure health check data is minimal but informative** to avoid exposing unnecessary service details (e.g., database password).
77. **Use Spring profiles** (e.g., `@Profile`) to conditionally enable or disable specific health checks based on environment (e.g., disable heavy checks in production).
78. **Include a dedicated `info` endpoint** to expose basic application information (version, build time) along with health checks.
79. **Customize health check failure messages** for better debugging insights (e.g., add error codes or specific service failure details).
80. **Use Actuatorâ€™s `health.status` property** to modify the output of the health check (e.g., `"DOWN"` instead of `"UP"` when a service fails).
81. **Validate health check endpoints under load** to ensure they are performant under heavy traffic conditions.
82. **Update `health-checks.yml` for specific service statuses** like "UP", "DOWN", "OUT_OF_SERVICE", or "UNKNOWN" as needed.
83. **Add custom logging for health service failures**, ensuring that logs capture reasons for the failure, such as timeouts or unavailability.
84. **Create a configuration property to customize the health check path** (e.g., `/custom-health` instead of `/health`).
85. **Define a grace period for health checks** to handle transient issues gracefully without marking services unhealthy prematurely.
86. **Integrate health check results with third-party monitoring tools** like Datadog, New Relic, or Dynatrace for enterprise-level monitoring.
87. **Use a monitoring agent to check system resource availability** (e.g., disk space, CPU usage) as part of custom health checks.
88. **Ensure health check endpoints are not exposed in production for sensitive environments** or require authentication if necessary.
89. **Test for service responsiveness** by configuring `@Timed` annotations for custom health check functions to measure response time.
90. **Provide a fallback mechanism for critical services in case of failures** to avoid service downtime due to health issues.
91. **Check that health check paths are tested with HTTP status codes like `200 OK`, `503 Service Unavailable`, or `500 Internal Server Error`.**
92. **Write health check summary reports** to automatically notify administrators when a health check fails.
93. **Implement cascading health checks** to evaluate related services (e.g., when database or external APIs fail, mark service health as "DOWN").
94. **Test custom health indicators independently** to validate isolated service failure impacts on health status.
95. **Define response time thresholds** in health checks to ensure services respond within expected time limits.
96. **Add Spring Profiles to configure environment-specific health checks**, such as database connection checks in production.
97. **Ensure that `management.endpoints.web.base-path` is set correctly** to avoid conflicts with other application paths.
98. **Add proper exception handling and return consistent error messages in health checks** when failures occur.
99. **Ensure that health checks are idempotent**, meaning calling them repeatedly does not affect service state.
100. **Create custom health check failure thresholds** in `application.yml` to define when to mark services as unhealthy based on repeated failures.
