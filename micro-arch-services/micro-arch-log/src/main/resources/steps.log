Here are 50 one-liner steps describing how the `micro-arch-log` module works:

1. The `micro-arch-log` module initializes log aggregation and configuration for a microservice.
2. It uses Spring Boot’s logging system, powered by Logback for logging configuration.
3. The `LogAggregator.java` class handles the central logic for logging aggregation.
4. The module is configured to handle multiple log levels like INFO, DEBUG, and ERROR.
5. Log entries are written both to the console and to log files.
6. The `LogConfig.java` class manages the log configuration settings.
7. The `logback-spring.xml` file is used to configure logging appenders and patterns.
8. Application logs are stored in the `logs` directory of the project.
9. The module supports rolling file appenders, which rotate logs daily.
10. Log files are named based on the date (`application-yyyy-MM-dd.log`).
11. The total log size is capped at 10GB, preventing excessive disk usage.
12. Old log files are retained for a maximum of 30 days.
13. It uses the Spring Profile feature to configure different log settings for `dev` and `prod` environments.
14. In development, logs are printed to the console with a detailed format.
15. In production, logs are written to files with a simpler format.
16. Logback’s rolling policy ensures logs are archived daily.
17. Console logging is enabled in the development profile for easy troubleshooting.
18. File-based logging is enabled in both profiles to retain logs for later analysis.
19. Spring’s default logging levels are used, with overrides for specific packages or classes.
20. The root logger is set to `INFO` level for general log entries.
21. Additional loggers can be configured for specific packages like `com.microservices.logs`.
22. The module ensures proper logging for health check-related events.
23. Custom loggers can be added to capture logs from specific components.
24. Application startup logs are captured to help with initial diagnostics.
25. Log entries include timestamps to provide precise event ordering.
26. Error logs are captured with details for debugging application issues.
27. Debug-level logs provide fine-grained details during development.
28. Information-level logs capture high-level application flow.
29. Warnings are logged for potential issues that don’t halt the application.
30. Error-level logs are used to log critical application failures.
31. The log pattern is configurable using properties like `LOG_PATTERN` in `logback-spring.xml`.
32. The log pattern includes the date, log level, logger name, and message.
33. The log pattern format is customizable for different log destinations (console/file).
34. Logback configuration supports conditional log formats based on the environment.
35. The module leverages Spring Boot’s dependency injection for configuring loggers.
36. Application performance issues are monitored through detailed logging.
37. The logback configuration uses `springProfile` elements to change log settings by environment.
38. Spring’s built-in `actuator` module is used for health checks and log monitoring.
39. The module uses `Slf4j` as the logging facade, ensuring flexibility across libraries.
40. The `logback-spring.xml` configuration is automatically detected by Spring Boot.
41. Error and exception stack traces are captured in the logs for easier debugging.
42. Logging configuration is separated into manageable files (`logback-spring.xml`).
43. The log module is easily configurable without requiring changes to application code.
44. Specific loggers are set up for critical modules such as `com.microservices.health`.
45. The logging configuration supports both system-wide and module-specific loggers.
46. Logger levels can be dynamically adjusted depending on the environment.
47. The module integrates with Spring Boot’s `@Profile` annotation for environment-specific logging.
48. All logging configurations are managed centrally through the `logback-spring.xml` file.
49. The log module ensures proper log management with advanced features like log rotation.
50. The logging configuration is designed for scalability, handling large-scale microservices applications.
