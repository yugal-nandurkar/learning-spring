### **50 One-Liner Steps to Understand How `micro-arch-tracer` Works**

1. Define the **module `micro-arch-tracer`** to add distributed tracing capabilities to microservices.
2. Add **OpenTelemetry dependencies** to `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` for tracing SDKs and OTLP exporter.
3. Create the `Tracing` configuration class to initialize OpenTelemetry with an OTLP exporter.
4. Use **`SdkTracerProvider`** to configure trace processing and connect the exporter.
5. Register a `SimpleSpanProcessor` to process and export spans efficiently.
6. Define an **endpoint for the OTLP exporter** (e.g., `http://localhost:4317`).
7. Implement a `TraceService` to demonstrate tracing use cases in business logic.
8. Start a span using `Tracer.spanBuilder()` for each logical operation.
9. Add attributes to spans, such as `input` or `output`, for trace detail enrichment.
10. Use `span.end()` to close spans after processing logic is completed.
11. Include `application.yml` to configure tracing settings in the Spring Boot application.
12. Set the Spring application name (e.g., `tracing-service`) for trace identification.
13. Enable Spring Actuator to expose application metrics, including tracing.
14. Optionally include **sampling configurations** (e.g., always sample for testing).
15. Create a `TracingUtils` utility class for reusable tracing methods.
16. Centralize span creation and termination logic in `TracingUtils`.
17. Develop a `TraceController` to expose REST endpoints for tracing operations.
18. Capture incoming requests in spans using `traceEndpoint`.
19. Handle request parameters and propagate them as trace attributes.
20. Return a processed response and record it in the trace span.
21. Set up `GlobalExceptionHandler` to manage errors and integrate tracing.
22. Use `Span.current()` to retrieve the active span during exception handling.
23. Record exceptions with `span.recordException()` for detailed trace logs.
24. Mark spans as `ERROR` using `span.setStatus(StatusCode.ERROR, ...)`.
25. Test the `TraceService` logic using JUnit with a mock OpenTelemetry SDK.
26. Verify trace attributes (`input`, `output`) during service method tests.
27. Write integration tests to validate span creation for REST endpoints.
28. Use OpenTelemetry Collector to process and forward trace data to a backend.
29. Configure the collector to accept OTLP traces on port `4317`.
30. Optionally forward traces to **Jaeger**, **Zipkin**, or other observability tools.
31. Deploy the service locally or in a containerized environment.
32. Start the OpenTelemetry Collector and tracing service in parallel.
33. Make a request to a traced REST endpoint (e.g., `/trace?input=test`).
34. Observe spans in the configured observability tool (e.g., Jaeger UI).
35. Verify span attributes like operation name, input, and output in the trace.
36. Analyze service flow by correlating spans using trace IDs.
37. Ensure context propagation between services for distributed tracing.
38. Integrate OpenTelemetryâ€™s context API to link parent and child spans.
39. Add middleware (e.g., Spring filters) to trace all incoming requests.
40. Export environment-based settings (e.g., `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`).
41. Use dynamic sampling to reduce overhead in production environments.
42. Apply instrumentation libraries for additional features like database tracing.
43. Configure log correlation to link logs with trace IDs.
44. Use a Baggage API to propagate custom attributes across service calls.
45. Extend tracing logic to handle asynchronous processing spans.
46. Scale the tracing service with lightweight spans for performance.
47. Debug and monitor tracing using logs and visualization tools.
48. Continuously validate tracing coverage for all critical service paths.
49. Optimize exporter configurations for production-grade observability.
50. Regularly update dependencies and observability stack for compatibility.
